As a clinician with a Master's in Healthcare Informatics, Iâ€™m passionate about reimagining healthcare through data and real-world evidence. My experience sits at the intersection of clinical practice, advanced analytics, and product innovation, bringing deep domain knowledge to teams building scalable, intelligent health tech solutions and storytelling with data.

I've contributed to cross-functional healthcare projects involving quality measure development (HEDIS, CMS), data abstraction from EHRs, claims mapping, and end-to-end reporting pipelines. I specialize in working with structured and unstructured data, transforming clinical documentation and observational datasets into actionable insights using a visualization dashboard that supports decision-making, research, and digital product development.

Specialties:

Cross-functional collaboration (Clinical + Tech + UX)

RWD analytics & population health informatics

SQL, Python, R, ETL pipelines, data modeling, and data visualization

Healthcare interoperability (FHIR, HL7, CDM/OMOP)
